**Wiz Remote App**

Wiz Remote App is my first SwiftUI application that lets you easily control a Wiz smart bulb straight from your Mac. It works by scanning through your local network to find the bulb’s IP address using UDP and sends commands directly to control the bulb.

When you turn the bulb on, it automatically sets to a warm white color that creates a cozy atmosphere.

**How It Works**

The app scans your Wi-Fi network to locate your bulb’s IP address by sending UDP packets. Once it finds the bulb, it communicates directly over the local network to control power and lighting.

**Features**

	•	Designed specifically for Wiz bulbs on Mac.
	•	No reliance on cloud services — everything stays local.
	•	Fast and responsive control.
	•	Made to fill the gap for Mac users who want simple, reliable bulb control.

Just a heads up, if the app doesn’t open right away, you might need to go to the settings, security, and allow apps from trusted developers. Also, the app needs your permission to scan the local network when you first open it.
